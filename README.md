# MVVM Implementation

A simple Android application demonstrating the Model–View–ViewModel (MVVM) architecture pattern using Kotlin and Jetpack components.

## Features
- Demonstrates MVVM architecture with clear separation of UI, business logic, and data layers.
- Uses **LiveData** and **ViewModel** for lifecycle‑aware data observation.
- Implements **Room** database for local persistence.
- Follows the repository pattern for data abstraction.
- Utilizes **Coroutines** and **Flow** for asynchronous operations.
- Clean architecture principles for easy testing and maintainability.

## Tech Stack
- **Kotlin** programming language.
- **Android Jetpack** components: LiveData, ViewModel, Room, Navigation.
- **Coroutines** and **Flow** for asynchronous programming.
- **Material Design** components for UI.
- **Dagger/Hilt** for dependency injection (if used).
- Unit and instrumentation tests using **JUnit** and **Espresso**.

## Getting Started
1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/shayann07/MVVM-Implementation.git
   ```

2. Open the project in Android Studio.
3. Let Gradle sync and download dependencies.
4. Run the app on an emulator or Android device.
5. Explore the code to understand MVVM architecture and adapt it to your own projects.
